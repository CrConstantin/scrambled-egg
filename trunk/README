  About:
----------

 - easily encrypt your data using AES, Blowfish, CAST, or DES3, then encode the result
    in a printable form, using Base64, Base32, HEX, Quopri, string escape, UU or XML;
 - the resulted string can be sent on e-mail as text, saved as XML or UU, or can be
    transformed into a little PNG image;

-----------------
  Requirements:
-----------------
 * Python 2.6. Scrambled-Egg is written entirely in Python 2.6. (www.python.org)
 * Python Crypto. Data is crypted in AES, Blowfish, DES3, etc. (www.pycrypto.org)
 * PyQt4. Graphical user interface with Qt. (www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt)

---------------
  How to use:
---------------
 * Graphical user interface can be accesed by opening "scrambled_egg.py" directly.
 * In order to access Scrambled-Egg class, all you have to do is : "import scrambled_egg".
 * Tested on Windows and Ubuntu.

---------------------------------
  Known Issues and Limitations:
---------------------------------
 * Try to evoid ROT13, and/or Quopri for binary files (images, music, Doc/Xls files, executables).
    The result after decoding might be differend from the original file !
 * Base32 Codec is VERY slow, so don't use it for large files.
 * The GUI will freeze for a looong time if you try to encrypt/ decrypt more than
    200.000-300.000 characters !

---------------
  What's new:
---------------
 * Version 0.3 brings the following changes :
    - better encryption. All modes use CBC;
    - images resulted from HEX codec are about 25% smaller than images resulted from Base64/32;
    - better testing. The program is stable. Tested on hundreds of files
      (images, music, office documents, executables);
    - the GUI looks nicer.

 * Version 0.2 brings quite some changes :
    - a lot of bug fixes;
    - stability obtained after MASSIVE testing;
    - all operations are faster;
    - added ARC2 encryption, Base32 and XML encodings;
    - import and export operations directly from GUI;
    - checkbox to show and hide pre/enc/post tags in resulted text.
