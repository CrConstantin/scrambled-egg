= Introduction =

Scrambled-Egg will help you compress and encrypt your data.
The resulted string can be sent on e-mail, or it can be transformed into an image.

= Details =

First of all, Scrambled-Egg is not a text editor. If you need scramble formatted text, use a text processor, then paste the formatted text in the left text-box. Scrambled-Egg supports HTML, so the formatting will be remembered upon encryption/ decryption.

The original data is scrambled in 3 steps :
  * Step 1, Pre : No processing, ZLIB, BZ2, or ROT13
  * Step 2, Real encryption : AES, Blowfish, CAST, DES3, or No encryption
  * Step 3, Post : Base64, HEX, Quopri, String, or UU Codec

All 3 steps are important, you should use them all.
The password is optional, and is used only for step 2 (encryption).
Only step 3 (post processing) is mandatory, the rest can be "None".

The resulted string begins with the text "_<#>pre:encryption:post<#>_", where "_pre_" represents one of the values from Step 1, "_encryption_" is one of the values from Step 2, and "_post_" is a value from Step 3. This tag can be deleted when sending the scrambled data, but it is necessary if you want to know how to decrypt the data back.
For example, if someone scrambles the data with BZ2 + DES3 + HEX, and you try to decrypt it with ZLIB + DES3 + HEX, it will fail. You will have to try all combinations of decryption, even if you already know the password !

A few examples of original text and resulted "scrambled" string :
  * you *must* destroy the _evidence_! -(password 'dodo')-> #Z:A:H#7939d292fef5a8eda1c27425b004dc7f683b52b96c633631ec8652042ba18c808bc76429dd364ca1fe5143888f1c7f979c119586a39dc3ae30f5ed1d7e160fe329bc85bea7e9f6605c0eab3bcbb1485a8505cada99b6e27265f230e3309a404a61ef5e59fbf0e3d51db8f59d06e13c0b1d8bd0397a843399e94494aca973e1763b23d83e9223ab84326a4d826247a863

  * Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ( ... ) Suspendisse potenti. (this text has 4025 characters) --> The resulted string has 2000 characters with BZ2/ AES/ Base64.
