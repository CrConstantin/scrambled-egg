First of all, Scrambled-Egg is not a text editor, so if you need to format your text, you must use a text processor, then paste the formated text in here. Scrambled-Egg supports HTML, so the formatting will be remembered.

Original text is "scrambled" in 3 steps :
  * Step 1, Pre : None, ZLIB, BZ2, ROT13
  * Step 2, Real encryption : AES, Blowfish, CAST, DES3, None
  * Step 3, Post : Base64, HEX, Quopri, String, UU Codec

All 3 steps are important, so you should use them.
